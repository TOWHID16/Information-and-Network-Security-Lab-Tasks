Web Lab 3 – AES Modes on Images (Towhid)

1) Environment
   - OS: Windows + PowerShell
   - OpenSSL: Win64 build
   - Working dir: E:\Alll\4-1\Lab Manual - 3

2) Files produced
   - Original: pic_original.bmp
   - Split: header.bin (54 bytes), body.bin
   - Keys: key.hex (AES-128 key, hex), iv.hex (IV, hex)
   - Encrypted bodies: body_ecb.bin / body_cfb.bin / body_ofb.bin
   - Corrupted bodies: body_*_corrupted.bin (1-byte at offset 1000 XOR FF)
   - Rebuilt images: image_* (original + corrupted)
   - Diff summaries: *_diff_summary.csv (first-diff offsets & per-block tallies)

3) Observations (what to check)
   - Headers (first 54 bytes) remain identical between original & corrupted images.
   - ECB: corruption shows as well-localized block artifacts in image.
   - CFB/OFB: corruption spreads stream-wise in ciphertext → visible streak/noise.
   - Hashes of bodies (original vs corrupted) differ, as expected.

4) Reproduce quickly
   - Use files listed above + run Task7_Verification.txt (hash/header checks).
   - Open image_*.bmp and compare with image_*_corrupted.bmp visually.
